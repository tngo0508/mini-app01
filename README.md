# CPSC 411- Mobile Device Application Development
# Fall 2018 - Mini-App 1, due October 11
## Introduction
You’ve switched to a new ISP who advertises speeds up to 100Mbps. Eager to take the network for a spin, you try to download a 100 MiB file. It takes over 10 seconds! Should you ask for your money back?
Regrettably, no. Network engineers measure speeds in bits per second (bps), and use decimal prefixes (1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps). Computer scientists measure file sizes in bytes and use binary prefixes (1 MiB = 1,024 KiB). The theoretical maximum transfer time for a 100MiB file over a 100Mbps link is a bit more 8 seconds.
To avoid miscommunication in the future, we’re going to make sure that there’s an app for that.
## User Interface
    + The app should have one activity.
    + The activity should contain two fields and at least three labels.
    + Each field should be labeled clearly, and include a hint for what the user should enter.
    + A larger label below the two fields should be used to show the computed result.
## Operation
    + The fields should allow the user to enter numeric values for network speed in Mbps and file size in MiB.
    + he larger label should show the computed transfer time in seconds.
    + As values in either field are changed, the transfer time should be recalculated.
## Specifications
    + The app should be written in Java
    + The app should accept integer values for network speed and file size
    + The fields should allow the user to enter only digits
    + The transfer time should be displayed to one decimal place (e.g. 8.4 seconds)
    + 1 B = 8 b; 1 MiB = 220 B; 1 Mbps = 106 bps
